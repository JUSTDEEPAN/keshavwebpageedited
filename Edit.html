<h1>World Environment Day</h1>
  
    <h3>World Environment on 5th June every year. People from more than 100 countries celebrate this day. Furthermore, the world 
    environment day is run by the <b>United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP).</b> Since the year 1973. Above all the main purpose 
    of celebrating this day was to spread awareness. The awareness was about the conservation of our environment.</h3>

<h3>Moreover to also take various preventive measures to avert the effects of Global warming. Since we all know that Global 
    warming is the root cause of the ruin of our environment. Therefore it is our duty to protect our environment. And stop  
    and the exploitation that is destroying it. Because in the end, it is our basic need for our survival and our generation
    ahead.</h3>
<h1>What do we do on World Environment Day?</h1>

<h3>On the world environment day, we all take a day off from our work. And join various campaigns to spread awareness about 
    environment protection. Moreover, we all plant small saplings in a barren land so that it may grow and flourish in the  
    land area after some years. Also, we take part in various processions to make people aware of this day. So that they may 
    also take part in protecting our environment.</h3>

<h3>Furthermore, in schools, the teachers teach the students the methods to plant a tree. The school provides buses to take  
    the students to the jungles. There they come to know about the different types of plants. And the types of vegetation in 
    which they survive. Also, the students have to bring a sapling from their homes and plant them inside the ground. This 
    helps them in getting practical knowledge. Further, it also creates an emotional attachment to the environment.</h3>
